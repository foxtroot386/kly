"# kly" 

Hi, my name's Timotius Randy PW
This is my first repository for a coding interview at Kapan Lagi Youniverse
This project was made using Laravel 5.8.

Here is the steps to deploy or serve my Laravel projects:
1. Download the projects and paste it anywhere on your computer
2. Open command prompt (administrator priveleges are not required) and navigate to project's root directory
3. Type in "php artisan serve" in your command prompt. If error messages appear telling you that "php" is not recognized as command, please install composer at https://getcomposer.org/download/ and try again
4. To view the project's web application, open your browser and type in URL 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000
5. That's it
